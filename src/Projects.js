          <p>Timeframe: 8 days - Technologies used: CSS, JavaScript, React, Python and PostgreSQL The brief on this project was to create a full-stack application. My main idea was for users to be able to search for cruises by destination, region or ship - Where they were then able to see what is onboard the cruise ship and a description of the area. I decided that I really wanted to do my final project on my own to concentrate on doing my own API and to test myself.</p>
